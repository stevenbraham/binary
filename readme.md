# About
This is a very basic integer to binary converter that I made when I was bored.

Currently it only accepts positive integers

# How to use

First you need to compile the program using the [g++](https://gcc.gnu.org/) compiler: `g++ binary.cpp`. Afterwards run the compiled program with a number as argument: `./a.out [number]`. If you input a valid number, you will see the binary equivalent or an error.
